           <p class="section-paragraph">H_art the band is a musical group made up of three young and acutely creative men. The three are Wachira Gatama, Mordecai Munyi, and Kenneth Muya. The trio goes under the monikers 'Skoko Abednego,' 'Mordecai Dez,' and 'Kenchez Muya,' respectively. Mordecai, the lyricist of the group, is quite a sensation as he gives the vocals an edge not present in other boys' bands in the country. Skoko Abednego is the bass-man who relays his lyrics in a poetic manner. His deep and guttural bass is a charm to the ladies, who scream each time he steps on the stage. The final member, Kenchez is also a vocalist but his main speciality is the guitar. His fingers are quick to prick out new tunes that the rest of the band can capitalize on to give their fans un-paralled entertainment.</p>  
            <p class="section-paragraph">Two of the members, Skoko and Kenchez were theater/setbook actors before meeting Mordecai. Initially, they did not know the potential they had but an audition they had in 2012 at the Kenya National Theater opened their eyes to what they could achieve together. A year later, they settled on their name; H-art the Band after fumbling with a few options including 'Waluyha na Swag.' In 2013, they released their first hit dubbed 'Uliza Kiatu.' The song explains the tribulations of a young man in the Nairobi dating world and expresses his feelings in a poetic yet emphathetic tone. The song became an instant hit and catapulted the trio to the limelight. They have not looked back ever since.</p>
